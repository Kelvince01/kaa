## üîß Configuration

### Basic Configuration
```typescript
const config = {
  recordingEnabled: true,
  outputDir: './recordings',
  format: 'webm',
  videoCodec: 'vp8',
  audioCodec: 'opus'
};
```

### Production Configuration
```typescript
const config = {
  recordingEnabled: true,
  storage: {
    type: 'cloud',
    cloud: {
      provider: 's3',
      bucket: 'my-recordings',
      region: 'us-east-1'
    }
  },
  videoBitrate: 2_500_000,
  audioBitrate: 128_000
};
```

## üêõ Known Limitations

1. **Track Capture**: Currently uses mock implementation
2. **Processing**: Simplified mixing algorithm (needs FFmpeg)
3. **Storage**: Cloud upload not fully implemented
4. **Performance**: Memory-based chunk storage (needs optimization)
