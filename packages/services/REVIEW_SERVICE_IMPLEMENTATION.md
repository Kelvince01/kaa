## Usage Examples

### Create a Review
```typescript
import { reviewsService } from '@kaa/services';

const review = await reviewsService.createReview({
  type: ReviewType.PROPERTY,
  targetId: 'property-id',
  title: 'Great property!',
  content: 'Very clean and well-maintained...',
  rating: {
    overall: 5,
    categories: {}
  },
  tags: ['clean', 'safe'],
  language: 'en',
  county: 'Nairobi',
  city: 'Westlands'
}, 'reviewer-user-id');
```

### Get Reviews with Filters
```typescript
const result = await reviewsService.getReviews({
  targetId: 'property-id',
  status: ReviewStatus.APPROVED,
  minRating: 4,
  verified: true,
  county: 'Nairobi',
  page: 1,
  limit: 20,
  sortBy: 'createdAt',
  sortOrder: 'desc'
});
```

### Moderate Reviews
```typescript
// Approve
await reviewsService.approveReview(
  'review-id',
  'moderator-id',
  'Looks good'
);

// Reject
await reviewsService.rejectReview(
  'review-id',
  'moderator-id',
  'Inappropriate content'
);

// Bulk moderate
await reviewsService.bulkModerateReviews(
  ['review-id-1', 'review-id-2'],
  'approve',
  'moderator-id'
);
```

### Get Analytics
```typescript
// Review stats
const stats = await reviewsService.getReviewStats('property-id', ReviewType.PROPERTY);

// User summary
const userSummary = await reviewsService.getUserReviewSummary('user-id');

// Property summary
const propertySummary = await reviewsService.getPropertyReviewSummary('property-id');

// Analytics over time
const analytics = await reviewsService.getAnalytics({
  startDate: new Date('2024-01-01'),
  endDate: new Date('2024-12-31'),
  type: ReviewType.PROPERTY,
  groupBy: 'month'
});
```

## Database Indexes

All necessary indexes are defined in the Review model:
- Compound indexes for efficient queries
- Text search index for full-text search
- Unique indexes to prevent duplicates
- Indexes for moderation queue
- Indexes for analytics queries

## Performance Considerations

1. **Async Operations**: Summary updates and notifications run asynchronously
2. **Pagination**: All list operations support pagination
3. **Selective Population**: Only necessary fields are populated
4. **Caching Ready**: Service methods return plain objects suitable for caching
5. **Batch Operations**: Bulk moderation for efficiency

## Security

1. **Permission Checks**: All operations validate user permissions
2. **Duplicate Prevention**: Prevents duplicate reviews and votes
3. **Input Validation**: Comprehensive validation of all inputs
4. **XSS Protection**: Content sanitization (handled by model validators)
5. **Rate Limiting Ready**: Service methods can be wrapped with rate limiters

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Unit Tests**: Test each service method independently
2. **Integration Tests**: Test with real database
3. **Permission Tests**: Verify all permission checks
4. **Edge Cases**: Test business hours, edit windows, auto-approval
5. **Performance Tests**: Test with large datasets
6. **Notification Tests**: Verify notification sending

## Future Enhancements

Potential additions (not currently implemented):
- [ ] AI-powered sentiment analysis (currently uses simple rating-based)

## Export

The service is exported as a singleton:
```typescript
export const reviewsService = new ReviewsService();
```

And also exported from the main services index:
```typescript
export * from "./properties/review.service";
```
