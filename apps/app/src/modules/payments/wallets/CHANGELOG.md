### Technical Details
- Built with React 18+ and TypeScript
- Uses @tanstack/react-query for data management
- Uses react-hook-form for form handling
- Uses Zod for schema validation
- Uses Tailwind CSS for styling
- Uses shadcn/ui component library
- Follows project code standards and .rules file
- Implements proper error boundaries
- Includes proper memoization and performance optimizations
- Regex patterns moved to top-level scope for performance
- Numeric literals use separators for readability
- All functions properly typed and documented

### API Integration
- `GET /wallets` - Get wallet balance
- `POST /wallets/deposit` - Initiate M-Pesa deposit
- `POST /wallets/withdraw` - Initiate M-Pesa withdrawal
- `POST /wallets/pay-rent` - Pay rent from wallet
- `POST /wallets/transfer` - Transfer funds to another wallet
- `GET /wallets/transactions` - Get transaction history
- `POST /wallets/callbacks/mpesa-deposit` - M-Pesa callback handler (backend)

### Security
- Phone number validation with strict regex
- Amount limits enforced on client and server
- Wallet status checks before transactions
- Transaction metadata logging
- Generic error messages (no sensitive data exposure)
- Balance verification before withdrawals and transfers

### Performance
- Lazy loading support for components
- Pagination for transaction lists (default 20 items)
- React Query caching with smart invalidation
- Optimistic updates for better UX
- Debounced form inputs
- Memoized calculations

### Accessibility
- ARIA labels on all interactive elements
- Keyboard navigation support
- Screen reader friendly
- Semantic HTML structure
- Focus management in dialogs
- Color contrast compliance

### Developer Experience
- Centralized exports via index.ts
- Comprehensive JSDoc comments
- TypeScript IntelliSense support
- Example implementations provided
- Clear error messages
- Consistent API patterns
