## What's this about?

[Kaa](https://www.kaapro.dev) has been live for roughly 1 months now, since Aug 2025. I've thoroughly enjoyed working on this piece as a side project and have been super heartened ❤️ to see many people using it, both in and out of where I work.

I've always admired how other products make use of changelogs and the addition of the [changelog](/changelog) page for Kaa is just a simple way to track some of my ongoing efforts with Kaa over time and see how far we've brought it since its inception.

## Updates

Outside of that, this page should also provide some update posts here and there on Kaa, so stay tuned if you're interested!
