# Financial Analytics API Implementation

## Overview

This document summarizes the implementation of missing analytics endpoints for the financial analytics application backend API. The implementation adds comprehensive analytics capabilities, batch import/export functionality, and extends the existing financial service with advanced query methods.

## New Schemas Added

### Import/Export Schemas
- `batchImportRequestSchema` - Schema for batch import requests with data type, data array, and options
- `importResultSchema` - Schema for import results including success/error counts and detailed feedback
- `exportConfigSchema` - Schema for export configuration including data type, format, filters, and options

### Analytics Schemas
- `expenseTrendSchema` - Schema for expense trends over time with period, amount, count, and change metrics
- `categoryAnalyticsSchema` - Schema for category-based analytics with amounts, counts, percentages, and trends
- `performanceMetricsSchema` - Schema for comprehensive performance metrics including income, expenses, ratios, and trends
- `comparativeAnalysisSchema` - Schema for period-to-period comparison analysis

## Enhanced Financial Service

### New Analytics Methods

#### `getExpenseTrends(landlordId, period, propertyId?)`
- Groups expenses by month using MongoDB aggregation
- Calculates period-over-period changes and percentages
- Returns time-series data for expense trends visualization

#### `getCategoryAnalytics(landlordId, currentPeriod, propertyId?)`
- Analyzes expenses by category with current vs previous period comparison
- Calculates category percentages of total expenses
- Provides trend analysis (change amounts and percentages)
- Returns sorted analytics by expense amount

#### `getPerformanceMetrics(landlordId, period, propertyId?)`
- Calculates comprehensive financial metrics including:
  - Total income, expenses, and net income
  - Profit margin and expense ratios
  - Average monthly expenses
  - Top expense categories (top 5)
  - Monthly expense trends

#### `getComparativeAnalysis(landlordId, currentPeriod, previousPeriod, propertyId?)`
- Compares financial performance between two periods
- Calculates changes in income, expenses, and net income
- Provides both absolute and percentage changes
- Returns structured comparison data

#### `batchImport(landlordId, dataType, data, options)`
- Supports importing expenses and assets in batch
- Handles column mapping for flexible data formats
- Validates required fields and applies defaults
- Returns detailed import results with error handling
- Supports skip validation and update existing options

## New API Endpoints

### Analytics Endpoints

#### `GET /financial/analytics/expense-trends`
**Query Parameters:**
- `startDate` (required) - Start date for analysis period
- `endDate` (required) - End date for analysis period
- `propertyId` (optional) - Filter by specific property

**Response:** Array of expense trend data points with period, amounts, counts, and changes

#### `GET /financial/analytics/category-analytics`
**Query Parameters:**
- `startDate` (required) - Start date for analysis period
- `endDate` (required) - End date for analysis period
- `propertyId` (optional) - Filter by specific property

**Response:** Array of category analytics with amounts, percentages, and trend comparisons

#### `GET /financial/analytics/performance-metrics`
**Query Parameters:**
- `startDate` (required) - Start date for analysis period
- `endDate` (required) - End date for analysis period
- `propertyId` (optional) - Filter by specific property

**Response:** Comprehensive performance metrics object with income, expenses, ratios, and trends

#### `GET /financial/analytics/comparative-analysis`
**Query Parameters:**
- `currentStart` (required) - Current period start date
- `currentEnd` (required) - Current period end date
- `previousStart` (required) - Previous period start date
- `previousEnd` (required) - Previous period end date
- `propertyId` (optional) - Filter by specific property

**Response:** Comparative analysis object with current/previous period data and comparison metrics

### Import/Export Endpoints

#### `POST /financial/import`
**Body:**
- `dataType` - Type of data to import ("expenses" or "assets")
- `data` - Array of data objects to import
- `options` - Import options including validation, column mappings, and update preferences

**Response:** Import result object with success/error counts and detailed feedback

#### `POST /financial/export`
**Body:**
- `dataType` - Type of data to export ("expenses", "assets", or "reports")
- `format` - Export format ("csv", "excel", "json", or "pdf")
- `filters` - Optional filters for data selection
- `options` - Export options including headers and metadata preferences

**Response:** Export configuration confirmation (placeholder - file generation to be implemented)

## Integration Features

### Security & Access Control
- All endpoints use existing `authPlugin` for authentication
- Proper RBAC integration with `accessPlugin` for financial permissions
- Read permissions for analytics endpoints
- Create permissions for import endpoint

### Error Handling
- Comprehensive error logging using the existing logger utility
- Structured error responses with appropriate HTTP status codes
- Input validation for required parameters
- Graceful handling of service failures

### Data Processing Features
- MongoDB aggregation pipelines for efficient analytics queries
- Automatic period calculation and comparison logic
- Flexible column mapping for import functionality
- Data validation and sanitization for imports
- Support for property-specific filtering across all endpoints

## Frontend Integration

These endpoints are designed to work seamlessly with the existing frontend import/export utilities:
- Import utilities can use the `/import` endpoint for batch operations
- Export utilities can use the `/export` endpoint for data extraction
- Analytics components can consume the analytics endpoints for dashboard visualizations
- All endpoints return data in formats expected by the frontend schemas

## MongoDB Aggregation Usage

The implementation leverages MongoDB aggregation pipelines for efficient analytics:
- Grouping expenses by time periods (monthly trends)
- Categorizing and summing expenses by type
- Calculating period-over-period comparisons
- Optimized queries with proper indexing considerations

## Next Steps

1. **File Generation**: Implement actual file generation for export functionality (CSV, Excel, PDF)
2. **Caching**: Add caching layer for frequently requested analytics data
3. **Background Jobs**: Implement background processing for large import/export operations
4. **Real-time Updates**: Add WebSocket support for real-time analytics updates
5. **Advanced Analytics**: Implement predictive analytics and forecasting capabilities

## Testing Recommendations

- Unit tests for all new service methods
- Integration tests for API endpoints
- Performance tests for aggregation queries
- End-to-end tests with frontend integration
- Load testing for import/export functionality

This implementation provides a robust foundation for financial analytics with comprehensive data processing, flexible import/export capabilities, and detailed performance metrics that integrate seamlessly with the existing application architecture.
